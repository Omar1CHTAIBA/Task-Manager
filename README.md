# Task Manager Application

A simple and lightweight Task Manager application built with PySide6 (Qt for Python) that provides real-time monitoring of system processes, CPU usage, memory usage, GPU usage, and network usage. This app utilizes `psutil` to fetch system data and displays it in tabbed views, including a table for processes and charts for resource usage.

## Features

- **Process Monitoring**: View running processes with details such as PID, process name, CPU usage, memory usage, and memory size in GB.
- **CPU Usage Monitoring**: Real-time CPU usage displayed in a line chart.
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Real-time memory usage displayed in a line chart.
- **GPU Usage Monitoring**: Placeholder for GPU usage monitoring (currently set to `0`, but can be extended based on available GPU libraries).
- **Network Usage Monitoring**: Placeholder for network usage monitoring (currently set to `0`, but can be extended based on available network monitoring libraries).
  
## Requirements

To run this application, you will need the following Python packages:

- PySide6
- psutil

You can install them using `pip`:
